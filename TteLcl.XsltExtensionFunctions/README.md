# TteLcl.XsltExtensionFunctions

This library contains objects that implement extension functions for use with
System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform.

The implementation is in F# rather than C# to use the more flexible identifier naming rules
of F# (as an example: unlike C#, F# can declare a method named 'get-segment()')
